# README
This repo has all the relevant code for my personal website, https://dfolsom.com/

It is hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The basis for the layout is the [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout), but at this point I've tweaked it to suit my preferences. It's quite easy to set up something like this for yourself; [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) may be useful.

## Education
<dl>
  <dt>Ph.D. in Physics</dt>
  <dd>Princeton University, Princeton, NJ<br> 2020 &ndash;</dd>

  <dt>B.A. <em>cum laude</em> in Physics, Mathematics, and Classical Studies</dt>
  <dd>Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN <br> 2016 &ndash; 2020</dd>
</dl>

## Research Experience
<dl>
  <dt>Undergraduate Honors Thesis Research</dt>
  <dd>Thesis title: "Next-to-Leading Order Simulation of Singlet Vector-like Quarks Decaying to a Bottom Quark and <em>W</em> Boson" <br> 2019 &ndash; 2020</dd>
</dl>
<div class="message">
<ul>
  <li> Supervised by Dr.&nbsp;Joseph Haley and Dr.&nbsp;Will Johns </li>
 <li> Used <tt>MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</tt> to generate samples of vector-like top partner pair production and decay in the <em>Wb+X</em> decay pathway, including showering in <tt>Pythia</tt> and analysis in <tt>Delphes</tt> </li>
 <li> Compared kinematics of the pair production events at leading-order and next-to-leading order in QCD perturbation</li>
 <li> Presented findings to the ATLAS Heavy Quarks and Top physics subgroup</li>
 <li> Findings to be included in the ATLAS <em>Wb+X</em> analysis internal note</li>
 <li> Earned highest departmental honors for the thesis and its defense</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt>NSF Physics Research Experience for Undergraduates</dt>
  <dd>at Oklahoma State University <br> 2019</dd>
</dl>
<div class="message">
<ul>
  <li> Supervised by Dr.&nbsp;Joseph Haley </li>
  <li> Contributed to an analysis searching for vector-like top partners decaying to a Higgs boson and top quark, attending and presenting at weekly meetings </li>
  <li> Analyzed data from RUN 2 of the ATLAS experiment at CERN to assess the efficiency of triggers used for the study, using the <tt>ROOT</tt> library </li>
  <li> Findings included in the internal note "Search for Single Vector-Like Quark Production Decaying to a Top Quark and a Higgs Boson in the Run 2 ATLAS Data," to be circulated to the ATLAS collaboration in September 2020</li>
</ul>

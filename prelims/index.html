<h1>About the Princeton Prelims</h1>

The Preliminary Exam is a two-day, six-hour exam that covers all of undergraduate physics. It is split into four sections: Mechanics, Electricity &amp; Magnetism, Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. On the first day, you have three hours to complete both the Mechanics and E&amp;M sections, and on the next day, you have three hours to complete the QM and Statmech sections.<br><br> 

This page contains both digitized versions of past problems and the notes that I used to prepare for the prelim. I hope this is helpful; feel free to contact me with any comments or suggestions!

<h2> My Suggested Resources </h2>
<bl>
<li>For Mechanics, I mostly relied on the book I used as an undergrad, Thornton and Marion. I read through Goldstein as well, but I didn't find the extra depth useful for this exam (though it's a great text!). </li><br>
<li>For E&amp;M, Griffiths' book is great, and I also really enjoyed Zangwill's sections on radiation and waveguides and cavities. </li><br>
<li>For Quantum, I don't have a strong preference; I bounced between Shankar, Townsend, and Griffiths. </li><br>
<li>For Statmech, nothing beats Tong's notes! There are also some heirloom Princeton resources on polymers that proved incredibly helpful; you can find them in my full notes post. </li><br>

<h1>Prelims Resources</h1>

This page contains both <a href='/prelims/problems'>digitized versions of past problems</a> and <a href='/prelims/notes'>the notes that I used to prepare for the prelim</a>. I hope this is helpful; feel free to contact me with any comments or suggestions!

<h2> My Suggested Resources </h2>
As far as general physics knowledge goes, my list of textbooks is pretty standard: <u>Thornton and Marion</u> and <u>Goldstein</u> for Mechanics, <u>Griffiths</u> and <u>Zangwill</u> for E&amp;M, <u>Townsend</u>, <u>Griffiths</u>, and <u>Shankar</u> for Quantum, and <u>Tong</u>'s notes for Statmech.<br><br>

You should also be aware of the <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/sh/peexovnmj1qg25l/AACMUMTgU717B4mOF_T6vv7Aa?dl=0'>solutions dropbox</a> contributed and maintained by some of the older grad students, as well as the <a href='http://princetonprelims.wikidot.com/'>older solutions website</a> and <a href='http://princetonprelim.com/'>a newer version of the site</a> which allows community solutions that anyone can edit.<br><br> 

There are some other heirloom Princeton resources which should be emailed out to you at some point, but this is my attempt at centralizing some of them and making them easier to navigate.

This page contains the notes that I used to prepare for the prelim. If you'd rather have them in pdf form, <a href='prelims-notes.pdf'>see here</a>. I hope this is helpful; feel free to contact me with any comments or suggestions!

<h2> My Suggested Resources </h2>
As far as general physics knowledge goes, my list of textbooks is pretty standard: <u>Thornton and Marion</u> and <u>Goldstein</u> for Mechanics, <u>Griffiths</u> and <u>Zangwill</u> for E&amp;M, <u>Townsend</u>, <u>Griffiths</u>, and <u>Shankar</u> for Quantum, and <u>Tong</u>'s notes for Statmech.<br><br>

One of the older students has also put together <a href='https://srossd.com/files/Undergraduate_Physics_in_a_Hurry.pdf'>Undergraduate Physics in a Hurry</a>, a really well-typeset prep guide which is "one-third exposition, one-third worked prelim problems, and one-third bad jokes" &ndash; the worked examples here in particular are incredibly valuable.<br><br>

You should also be aware of the <a href='https://www.dropbox.com/sh/peexovnmj1qg25l/AACMUMTgU717B4mOF_T6vv7Aa?dl=0'>solutions dropbox</a> contributed and maintained by some of the older grad students, as well as the <a href='http://princetonprelims.wikidot.com/'>older solutions website</a> and <a href='http://princetonprelim.com/'>a newer version of the site</a> which allows community solutions that anyone can edit.<br><br> 

There are some other heirloom Princeton resources which should be emailed out to you at some point, but this is my attempt at centralizing some of them and making them easier to navigate.

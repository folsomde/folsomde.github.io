I am working on a number of projects that are nearing completion but are not yet publicly available on the arXiv. For the duration of the postdoc application process, I have decided to disclose drafts of the manuscripts that are closest to a public release as a sign of good faith that such work will indeed be completed soon. 

This page is subject to updates as new manuscripts reach a stage where I am comfortable disclosing them.
- **2025/10/27:** Empirical Speed Distributions paper now public, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21914">arXiv:2510.21914</a>

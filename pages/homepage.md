I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at Princeton University; I work with [Mariangela Lisanti](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/mariangela-lisanti). 
My work is focused on the theory of galaxy formation and evolution, especially regarding dwarf galaxies and Milky Way satellites. I'm interested broadly in the physics of galactic dynamics and how this informs the study of dark matter.


I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2020 with a B.A. *cum laude* in Physics, Mathematics, and Classical Studies.

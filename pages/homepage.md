I am a fifth-year PhD candidate at Princeton University; I work with [Mariangela Lisanti](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/mariangela-lisanti). 
I'm interested broadly in the physics of dwarf galaxies, galactic dynamics, and how these inform the study of dark matter around our Galaxy.
In particular, I use computational methods to study Milky Way satellites, Galactic archaeology, and (in)direct detection of dark matter. 

I graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2020 with a B.A. *cum laude* in Physics, Mathematics, and Classical Studies.

A piece of thin uniform unstretchable rope has length $2L$ and mass $M$. Its ends are attached to points at the same height separated by distance $2w$, and the rope hangs between them under the influence of gravity (of course, $w < L$). Let us set up coordinates $(x,\,y)$ in the plane of the rope, so that the ends points have equal values of $y$, and $x = \pm w$. You will be asked to determine the vertical coordinate of the rope, $y$, as a function of $x$.

**a.** Write down the functional of $y(x)$ that has to be minimized. What is the form of the constraint?

**b.** One may think of the functional to be minimized as an action for a 1-dimensional particle with coordinate $y$ and time $x$. Find a conserved quantity.

**c.** For a given value of the conserved quantity, find $y(x)$. What is the equation relating the conserved quantity to $w$ and $L$?

excerpt: In this paper, I search Milky Way&ndash;like galaxies in <code>IllustrisTNG50</code> for mergers that resemble the GSE, our most recent major merger, and find them a third of the time. I allow for the GSE to be comprised of two mergers, rather than necessarily being a single merger; these pairs account for approimately a third of the GSEs. It's hard to tell single- from two-merger GSEs apart, except that the single mergers are typically accreted more recently.

Observations of the Milky Way's stellar halo find that it is predominantly comprised of a radially-biased population of stars, dubbed the <i>Gaia</i> Sausage&ndash;Enceladus, or GSE. These stars are thought to be debris from dwarf galaxy accretion early in the Milky Way's history. Though typically considered to be from a single merger, it is possible that the GSE debris has multiple sources. To investigate this possibility, we use the <code>IllustrisTNG50</code> simulation to identify stellar accretion histories in 98 Milky Way analogues&mdash;the largest sample for which such an identification has been performed&mdash;and find GSE-like debris in 32, with two-merger GSEs accounting for a third of these cases. Distinguishing single-merger GSEs from two-merger GSEs is difficult in common kinematic spaces, but differences are more evident through chemical abundances and star formation histories. This is because single-merger GSEs are typically accreted more recently than the galaxies in two-merger GSEs: the median infall times (with 16th and 84th percentiles) are $$5.9_{-2.0}^{+3.3}$$ and $$10.7_{-3.7}^{+1.2}$$ Gyr ago for single- and two-merger scenarios, respectively. The systematic shifts in abundances and ages which occur as a result suggest that efforts in modeling these aspects of the stellar halo prove ever-important in understanding its assembly.

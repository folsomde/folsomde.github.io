excerpt: "Observations of the Milky Way's stellar halo find that it is predominantly comprised of a radially-biased population of stars, dubbed the <em>Gaia</em> Sausage&ndash;Enceladus, or GSE. These stars are thought to be debris from dwarf galaxy accretion early in the Milky Way's history. Though typically considered to be from a single merger, it is possible that the GSE debris has multiple sources. To investigate this possibility, we use the <code>IllustrisTNG50</code> simulation to identify stellar accretion histories in 98 Milky Way analogues &ndash; the largest sample for which such an identification has been performed &ndash; and find GSE-like debris in 32, with two-merger GSEs accounting for a third of these cases. Distinguishing single-merger GSEs from two-merger GSEs is difficult in common kinematic spaces, but differences are more evident through chemical abundances and star formation histories. This is because single-merger GSEs are typically accreted more recently than the galaxies in two-merger GSEs: the median infall times (with 16th and 84th percentiles) are \\(5.9^{+3.3}_{-2.0}\\) and \\(10.7^{+1.2}_{-3.7}\\) Gyr ago for these scenarios, respectively. The systematic shifts in abundances and ages which occur as a result suggest that efforts in modeling these aspects of the stellar halo prove ever-important in understanding its assembly."

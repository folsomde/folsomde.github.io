excerpt: Predictions for the local dark matter speed are crucial for interpreting the data from direct detection experiments, but the current state of the art fails to properly quantify astrophysical uncertainties. I address this shortcoming using the largest, highest-resolution simulation to date, definitively characterizing halo-to-halo variance. I propose a novel analysis procedure that dramatically improves the precision of our prediction compared to previous studies, on par with other systematics.

The sensitivity of direct detection experiments depends on the phase-space distribution of dark matter near the Sun, which can be modeled theoretically using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way--like galaxies. However, capturing the halo-to-halo variation in the local dark matter speeds---a necessary step for quantifying the astrophysical uncertainties that feed into experimental results---requires a sufficiently large sample of simulated galaxies, which has been a challenge. In this work, we quantify this variation with nearly 100 Milky Way&ndash;like galaxies from the `TNG50` simulation, the largest sample to date at this resolution. Moreover, we introduce a novel phase-space scaling procedure that endows every system with a reference frame that accurately reproduces the local standard-of-rest speed of our Galaxy, providing a principled way of extrapolating the simulation results to real-world data. The predicted speed distributions are consistent with the Standard Halo Model, a Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann distribution peaked at the local circular speed and truncated at the escape speed. The dark matter&ndash;nucleon cross section limits placed by these speed distributions vary by ~60% about the median. This places the 1&#963; astrophysical uncertainty at or below the level of the systematic uncertainty of current ton-scale detectors, even down to the energy threshold. The predicted uncertainty remains unchanged when sub-selecting on those `TNG50` galaxies with merger histories similar to the Milky Way. Tabulated speed distributions, as well as Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann fits, are provided for use in computing direct detection bounds or projecting sensitivities.

  <figcaption class='message'>Dark matter speed distributions at the Solar radius, both before (blue) and after (pink) scaling the simulated halos. The shaded bands are binwise containment regions, bracketing the 16th-to-84th percentile of the distributions. The solid blue and pink lines show best-fit truncated Maxwell&ndash;Boltzmann probability distributions for the scaled and unscaled halos, respectively, and the black dashed line indicates the Standard Halo Model prediction. The Milky Way is more compact on average than the simulated halos, so we apply a scaling to compress them, which correspondingly increases the speed of their DM particles. With these higher speeds, the scaled halos better recover the local standard-of-rest speed $v_\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle LSR}$ (shown with a vertical gray line).</figcaption>

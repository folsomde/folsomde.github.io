### Constraints
<div class = "message"><strong>Def.&ensp;</strong> A <em>holonomic constraint</em> is one that can be written $$f(\vb{r}_1,\, \vb{r}_2,\,\dots;\;t) = 0$$</div>
* e.g. rigid body motion, $$ (\vb{r}_i - \vb{r}_j)^2 - c_{ij}^2 = 0$$
* inequalities, differentials, derivatives are nonholonomic

<div class = "message"><strong>Def.&ensp;</strong> A <em>rheonomous constraint</em> is one that contains a dependence on time. Otherwise, the constraint is called <em>scleronomous</em>.</div>

### Lagrange's equation
<em>N.B.: There's a really nice derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations in this section.</em>


As a condition for equilibrium, we have the principle of virtual work:
\begin{equation}
	\sum \vb{F}_ i^{(a)} \cdot \delta \vb{r}_ i = 0
\end{equation}
This condition is sufficient whenever the virtual work of the constraint forces vanishes; however, the $\delta \vb{r}_ i$ are still related by the constraints, and it deals only with statics. To include dynamics, we use D'Alembert's condition, 
\begin{equation}
	\sum (\vb{F}_ i^{(a)} - \vb{p}_ i)\cdot \delta \vb{r}_ i = 0
\end{equation}
In generalizing D'Alembert's condition to unconstrained degrees of freedom, we arrive at
\begin{equation}
	\dv{t}\pdv{T}{\dot{q}_ j} - \pdv{T}{q_ j} = Q_j = \vb{F}_ i\cdot \pdv{\vb{r}_ i}{q_j}
\end{equation}
Assuming that the forces $\vb{F}_ i$ are derivable from a velocity-independent scalar potential, we arrive at the usual expression of the Euler-Lagrange equations:
\begin{equation}
\dv{t}\pdv{L}{\dot{q}_ j} - \pdv{L}{q_ j} = 0
\end{equation}

### Velocity-dependent potentials
Instead of taking $Q_i = -\pdv{V}{q_i}$, we can also say 
\begin{equation}
Q_i = -\pdv{U}{q_i} + \dv{t}\qty(\pdv{U}{\dot{q}_ i})
\end{equation}
and the Euler-Lagrange equations retain the same form.

If there are forces $Q_i$ which are _not_ derivable from potentials, we can still solve the Euler-Lagrange equations, though now in a nonhomogeneous form; we set the left-hand-side equal to the $Q_i$. An example is the Rayleigh dissipation function 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F} = \frac{1}{2}\sum(k_x v_{ix}^2 + k_y v_{iy}^2 + k_z v_{iz}^2)
\end{equation}
for which the force is given by 
\begin{equation}
Q_j = -\pdv{\mathcal{F}}{\dot{q}_ j}
\end{equation}

## Chapter 2 <a name="chapter2"></a> 
This section has the standard variational derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations.

### Hamilton's principle for nonholononmic systems
<div class = "message"><strong>Def.&ensp;</strong> A <em>semiholonomic constraint</em> is one that can be written in the form
\begin{equation}
	f(q,\, \dot{q}) = 0.
\end{equation}
Such constraints are often restricted to the form $a^k \dd{q_k} + a^t \dd{t} = 0$.
</div> 
We include these constraints using Lagrange multipliers. The sketch is as follows:
1. Since the constraint equations $f_\alpha$ are identically zero, we can say
\begin{equation}
\delta\int(L-\lambda^\alpha f_\alpha) \dd{t} = 0
\end{equation}
2. Solving the variation gives the nonhomogeneous Euler-Lagrange equations for forces of constraint
\begin{equation}
Q_j = \sum \lambda^\alpha \qty[\pdv{f_\alpha}{q_j} - \dv{t}\pdv{f_\alpha}{\dot{q}_j}] - \dv{\lambda^\alpha}{t} \pdv{f\scriptsize\alpha}{\dot{q}_j}
\end{equation}

Note that this method requires that the constraint forces do no work in virtual displacements.

### Jacobi's integral
This chapter also defines Jacobi's integral $h$ as numerically equivalent to the Hamiltonian (though still written in terms of $\dot{q}$). The standard "time-dependent Lagrangian leads to time-dependent $h$" argument is carried out, and it is also noted that if there is a dissipation function $\mathcal{F}$, we have
\begin{equation}
	\dv{h}{t} = - 2\mathcal{F} - \pdv{L}{t}
\end{equation} 
giving the rate of energy loss.

## Chapter 3 <a name="chapter3"></a>
Written in terms of plane-polar coordinates and the conserved angular momentum $\ell = mr^2\dot{\theta}$, we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2}m\dot{r}^2 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\ell}{mr^2} + V = E
\end{equation}
from which we can define the effective potential including the angular momentum term.

So, this is my first blog post! I suppose I should introduce myself; I'm an incoming graduate student at Princeton University, and I graduated from Vanderbilt University this summer amidst all the coronavirus tumult. I've been thinking of setting up a personal website/blog for a while now, and I figured this was a significant enough point in my life to merit its creation. I plan to make this a central hub for my online academic presence, and I'll keep this updated with various things that I'm learning. I've wanted to have a place to store my notes and share my thoughts & progress while I grow as a student, and finally took the leap!

### This Blog
Setting up this blog has been a fun little project! For anyone thinking of following suit, I'm using [Jeckyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with the [Hydeout](https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/) theme, forked from Andrew Fong's GitHub page. I'm hosting it via GitHub Pages, which provides one free site hosted for every user. It's fairly straightforward once you get the hang of it; all these posts are formatted with Markdown, which makes them quite easy to write and edit.

### Currently Studying
I've been using this summer to start prepping for the prelim in January. It doesn't seem I'll have a thorough examination of the pillars of physics next semester; instead, I will be in classes more devoted to problem-solving techniques. In order to make sure I don't have any gaps in my undergraduate education, I figured I would cover the major topics while I have free time. To this end, I've planned to read:  

1. Goldstein's *Classical Mechanics*
2. Shankar's *Principles of Quantum Mechanics*
3. Kardar's *Statistical Physics of Particles*
4. Zangwill's *Modern Electrodynamics*

As of now, I've finished Goldstein and am about halfway through Shankar, and they've been very enjoyable reads! Of course, there are some small things that my undergraduate courses didn't cover, but that is to be expected of a graduate-level text. It's been a heartening experience, though, and I'm excited to see what the future holds!

I am in the process of TeX-ing up my notes as I've been reading (as I began reading while away from my computer), and I've been meaning to digitize my undergraduate notes as well, though we'll see how much effort that is worth -- I think it may be better to cherry-pick and record only that which isn't incredibly fundamental so that they would be worth something to look back at later. Regardless, I suppose that's all I have to write about for now! There will -- I hope -- be more posts to come soon!

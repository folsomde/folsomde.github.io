I am in the process of digitizing the problems hosted on [the repository of past exams](https://phy.princeton.edu/graduate-program/degree-requirements/graduate-preliminary-exams). I've added tags so that they are more easily searchable, which hopefully helps when looking for practice problems. You can see the problems organized by their tags [here](/tags). Good luck!

I have hosted here the problems given on [the repository of past exams](https://phy.princeton.edu/graduate-program/degree-requirements/graduate-preliminary-exams). I'm in the process of adding tags so that they are more easily searchable, which hopefully helps when looking for practice problems. You can see the problems organized by their tags [here](/tags). I'm still in the mid-00s when it comes to tagging, but I'm updating regularly. I hope to have it done before crunch time sets in, haha. Good luck!

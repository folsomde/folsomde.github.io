Below I've posted the notes I wrote for myself when studying for the prelims. Let me know if there are any other resouces I ought to have listed here! 

They're a little messy given that I made them to be a super quick reference as I did practice problems. Eventually I might polish them up, but for now they are just as I left them.

If you'd rather have them in pdf form, <a href='prelims-notes.pdf'>see here</a>.

Below I've posted the notes I wrote for myself when studying for the prelims. Let me know if there are any other resouces I ought to have listed here! 

They're a little messy (I typed them up in just two days), but I still found them useful!

If you'd rather have them in pdf form, <a href='prelims-notes.pdf'>see here</a>.

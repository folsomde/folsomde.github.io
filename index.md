## About me
I am an incoming graduate student at Princeton University; I earned my undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt University in 2020. My research interests center around phenomenological physics; I enjoy the bridge it provides between theory and experiment. As an undergraduate researcher, I worked on projects in high-energy physics with the ATLAS experiment, particularly regarding searches for beyond-the-Standard Model phenomena through heavy quark dynamics. I worked primarily with [Dr.&nbsp;Joseph Haley](https://haley.okstate.edu/) of Oklahoma State University on vector-like quark model phenomenology.

This is my personal website, a central hub for my academic online presence! Here you can find [the rest of my online presence]({{ "/contact"|relative_url}}), a digital version of [my curriculum vit&aelig;]({{ "/curriculum_vitae"|relative_url}}) containing information on my current and past projects, as well as a [blog]({{ "/blog"|relative_url}}) where I post notes from my studies and other updates on what I'm learning!

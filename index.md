## About me
I am a third-year graduate student at Princeton University working in the particle phenomenology group under [Dr.&nbsp;Mariangela Lisanti](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/mariangela-lisanti). My current projects center around computational models for galactic formation and evolution: I'm interested in uncovering what these processes imply for the physics of dark matter. I earned my undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt University in 2020. As an undergraduate researcher, I worked on projects in high-energy physics with the ATLAS experiment.

This is my personal website, a central hub for my academic online presence! Here you can find [the rest of my online presence]({{ "/contact"|relative_url}}), a digital version of [my curriculum vit&aelig;]({{ "/curriculum_vitae"|relative_url}}) containing information on my current and past projects, as well as a [page]({{ "/prelims"|relative_url}}) where I host my notes for the Princeton preliminary exam!

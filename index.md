## About me
I am a fifth-year graduate student at Princeton University working with [Mariangela Lisanti](https://phy.princeton.edu/people/mariangela-lisanti). My current projects center around computational modeling of galaxy formation and evolution, especially pertaining to dwarf galaxies and Milky Way satellites: I'm interested broadly in the physics of galactic dynamics, as well as how this pertains to dark matter. I earned my undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt University in 2020.

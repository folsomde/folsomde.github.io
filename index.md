This is my personal website, a central hub for my academic online presence! Here you can find a digital version of [my curriculum vit&aelig;]({{ "/curriculum_vitae"|relative_url}}) containing information on my current and past projects, as well as a [blog]({{ "/blog"|relative_url}}) where I post notes from my studies and other updates on what I'm learning!
